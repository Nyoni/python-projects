DESIGNING A GAME 
-first thing is defining what makes a 2D game a platformer

2D Platformer Game Characteristics
-The player jumps and climbs between various platforms on the game field.
-The platforms oxen feature uneven terrain and uneven height placements.
-Obstacles are placed in the player’s path and must be overcome to reach a goal.

Requirement for a 2D Platform Game
-Multiple levels of increasing difficulty
-Rewards available throughout the game
-Multiple player lives
-Ability to destroy game obstacles

Game Story
**********

Game Mechanics
-This is how you will control gameplay. 
-Moving the player around the game field requires a way to control several 
different movements.
-← Left and → Right to move on a platform
-↑ Up and ↓ Down to climb ladders between platforms
-Jump to collect coins, avoid enemies, or move between platforms
-You aren’t limited to just keyboard input, either. 
-The arcade library includes support for joysticks and game controllers.

Game Assets
-The idea of how the game should work is now there,
-Now a decision has to be made on how the game will look and sound. 
-The images, sprites, sounds, and even text used to display the score are 
collectively known as assets. 
-They define the game in the eyes of the players. 
-Its a challenge creating them taking as much time, if not more, than writing
 the actual game code.

Program Structure
-The final step before writing code is deciding how you will structure and store 
everything
-Because video games consist of graphic and sound assets as well as code, it’s
important to organize the project. 
-Keeping game assets and code properly organized will enable the making of 
targeted changes to the design or behavior of your game while minimizing the 
impact to other game aspects.

The project uses the following structure

Arcade Game/

-Under the root folder of the project are the following subfolders:
-arcade_game holds all the Python code for the game.
-assets consists of all your game images, fonts, sounds, and tile maps.
-tests contains any tests written.
